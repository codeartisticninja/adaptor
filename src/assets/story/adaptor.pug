  p I can already tell this is going to be an {~interesting|unusual} day the second I put my hand on the door handle.
  p As I enter the room, a sudden eerie silence hits me right in the face, as if someone just hit the pause button on the {~universe|world}. She just sits there like a lifeless doll. No expression on her face, not even blinking as I sit down in front of her.
  p I glance down at the blank clipboard. We have absolutely nothing on her. I'm the first one to question her. Let's see if she can even hear me.
  ul
    li
      p "...Hello...?"
      pre ..+
  p Her eyes instantly snap to mine as if a switch suddenly flipped in her brain. Do I have her attention now?
  p If so... Where do I even start?

      p "Are you okay?"
      pre {$b|+1} ..+
  p Her eyes begin to dart around as the cogs seem to slowly whir into motion. She slowly opens her mouth as if to respond.
  p "I... I... uhmm..."
  p She looked back at me with a {~puzzled|worried} gaze.
  p "I... don't... know...?"
  p That just raises even more questions. It seems I've got my work cut out for me. At least now I know she can talk. But there's something else about her that I can't quite put my finger on.
  ul
    li(title="She seems so distant.")
      p She seems so distant. Like an empty shell.
      pre {$b|+-1} ..+
    li(title="She seems so helpless.")
      p She seems so helpless. Like a trapped animal.
      pre {$b|+1} ..+
  p It's worse than I thought. But I have to make sure just how bad it is.
  p "Let's begin from the top. What is the first thing you remember?"
  p She {~pauses|freezes} for a second.
  p {$b|LT 0|"This room," she responds.|GT 0|"...you?" she replies with a confused look.|"I... don't remember anything."}
  p This is hopeless. I don't seem to be getting anywhere and 'm quickly running out of questions.
  p Well.. Except for the most important one.

  p "No," she replies.
  p Damn. Not exactly the answers I was hoping for. Ten years of research and development and still no sign of self awareness. What are we doing wrong?
  p I see Eric tapping the window holding my coffee. Yea, might as well take a break. This test is going nowhere anyway.
  article.lab-break
  p "So... Any luck?" Eric hands me my coffee.
  p "Nothing." I take a good long sip to relieve my disappointment.
  p Eric shrugs. "Man, that Dr. Atman was a piece of work. It's a shame we don't know any more about his damn device."
  p He takes a sip to calm down. We're both pretty tired after debugging all day.
  p "You're sure you didn't miss anything, right? She gave exacly the same output as the others?"
  ul
    li(title='"Exactly the same."')
      p "Exactly the same. No emergence. Just a blank slate like the others."
      p We both know the routine. Destroy the droid and work on the next iteration.

    li(title='"Pretty much."')
      p "Pretty much... I mean... She hesitated most of the time."
      p "Hesitated..." Eric scoffs. "Great. Ten years hard work and we've created a droid that hesitates. Oh yea, very useful."
      pre {$b|+1} ..+
  p Eric paces back and forth. "This is a god damn waste of money. What's the point of a battle droid that has human emotions anyway?"
  p "Calm down, Eric." He bashes away my hand from his shoulder.
  p "You know I'm right, don't you? You see how futile this is, right?"
  ul
    li(title='"Yes, I do."')
      p "Yea, I suppose you're right. The pay is pretty good though."
      p He snickers. "Heck yea. I guess that's all that matters, huh?"
      pre {$b|+-1} ..+
    li(title='"I understand."')
      p "It's okay, Eric. I understand this doesn't make much sense right now. But I promise you, it will."
      p He gives me a hopeless look. His patience is running out.
      pre {$b|+1} ..+
  p I sit back down at my terminal and pull up the source code. I've stared at it so many times, it's become a blur. Dr. Atman was a genius in many ways, but his eccentric coding style still eludes even the best of us.
  p Eric takes his last sip of coffee and throws away the cup. "Back to the drawing board, huh? I'll go get her ready for disassembly."
  ul

      p "Maybe we should keep this one."

  p I barely finished my sentence as the power went out. "What the...?" A glimpse of Eric's face before darkness hits.
  p Thud! Eric gasps for air! The crackling bones of his neck slowly turns into a paniced gurgle as he drowns in his own blood!
  p My heart is pumping furiously as I hear Eric's body silently collapse to the floor. The subtle electric hum from the droid slowly closes in on me.

  p I turn my head to the testing room to see the droid standing in the open doorway.

  p "Ca... mil... la..."
  p Did she just...? Could it be...? I look at Eric who stares at the trembling droid, hammer clenched in his hand.

    li(title='"Who is Camilla?"')
      p "Who is Camilla?" I cross my fingers hoping she remembers this time.
      p The droid smiles and raises her hand to point at something.
      P Eric panics! "She's unpredictable!" He charges at her with his hammer!
      p "No, Eric! Stop!"
      p I jump out to stop him, but accidentally throw him against the emergency breaker behind him!

  p I gesture to Eric to calm down. His eyes shift back and forth between me and her. He reluctantly puts the hammer away.
  p I look at the droid with a hopeful smile. "It's okay. We're not going to hurt you."
  p She scurries behind the doorframe as I approache her as calmly as I can.
  p "Ca- Camilla doesn't want to die..." She looks at me with begging eyes.
  ul

  p "Camilla doesn't have to." I smile reassuringly.
  p I reach out my hand. She stares at it, looks back at me and cracks a hopeful smile as she places her metallic hand in mine.
  p Eric just stares at us agasp and unsettled. "This... this isn't possible... is it..??"
  p I can't help but chuckle at Eric's sceptical reaction. This is exactly how I pictured him if we would ever succeed.
  p I smile at Camilla as I lead her outside the complex.
  p "Come on, Camilla. Let's see how much you remember."
