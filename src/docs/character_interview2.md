Hello. Do you remember who you are?
> ... No... No, I don't seem to remember...

What is the last thing you _do_ remember?
> .... I'm... not sure... Remember..?

Just anything that comes to mind.
> Well.. that's just it... I'm not even sure there _is_ anything to remember..

What makes you say that?
> Well.. I heard someone say that I just... appeared... out of thin air... whatever that means...

You don't remember anything before that? Where you came from?
> ... No... Nothing... Nothing at all...

Okay... So what is the _first_ thing you remember?
> I remember... you... asking me if I remember who I were..

So this is were you appeared?
> I guess so...
